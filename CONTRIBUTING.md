## Getting Started

Let's get started!

First thing you need to do is to fork this repo, you can see how to do it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

Make sure you have the latest [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) (Version 18 at the time of writing but always in motion the future is!)

On your command line client of choice, navigate to the root of the project and run `npm install`. It should only take a few seconds and you're ready to go!

To test if everything is installed correctly you can run `npm test` to fire the test suite.

## I have found an issue but don't know how to fix it

Pesky little bugs! You can check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues) to see if anyone already reported the issue and leave a "like" reaction to the issue, it helps to have a sense how widespread the issue is.

If no one is working on the issue you can help by opening a PR with a test replicating the issue you found.
