## Getting Started

Let's get started!

First thing you need to do is to fork this repo, you can see how to do it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

Make sure you have the latest [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) (Version 18 at the time of writing but always in motion the future is!)

On your command line client of choice, navigate to the root of the project and run `npm install`. It should only take a few seconds and you're ready to go!

To test if everything is installed correctly you can run `npm test` to fire the test suite.

## I have found an issue but don't know how to fix it

Pesky little bugs! You can check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues) to see if anyone already reported the issue and leave a "like" reaction to the issue, it helps to have a sense how widespread the problem is.

If the issue hasn’t been reported yet, you can [create a new one](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues/new) and try to leave as much detail as you can to reproduce the issue.

Even better, you can help by opening a PR with a test replicating the issue you found. Having a test failing will make it easier to come up with a solution.

## I have found an issue and have a solution for it

You absolute legend! [Open a new issue](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues/new) describing the problem and then open a PR linking to the issue. Don’t forget to add tests!

High fives all-round, you’re a beautiful human being!

## I have an idea for a new feature but not sure how to implement it

Worry not! [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues/new) describing your idea and tell us what your use case is. We’ll review it and if it fits our goals, we’ll add it to our backlog.

## I have an idea for a new feature and I'm ready to code

Good stuff! [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sardinedev/colour/issues/new) describing your idea, tell us what your use case is and let us know you are available to implement it. We’ll review it and if it fits our goals, we’ll add it to our backlog and assign it to you.
